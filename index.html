					Accurate expression of your thoughts 

					We learn to write code in order to:
					- learn to express ourselves accurately
					- to get feedback from each other on our algorithms
					- to get feedback from machines 
					- to get feedback from people
					- to get feedback from ourselves 
					- if you are protected from making mistakes, you will not learn from those mistakes

				<section>
Writing code is.... 

Not just about syntax 
It's about expressing your thoughts clearly 
So your thoughts come to life 
So your ability to think can improve  
</section>

<section>
	<h2>TLDR</h2>
	If you outsource your thinking to AI you will be a weak problem solver
	If you dont learn to read code you will not be able to validate or learn from code
	If you dont learn to express your thoughts precisely, your thoughts wont come to life, and you wont get to build on them.

</section>

<section>
	One day AI will be able to solve bigger problems 
	=> noob develpers will be able to solve bigger problems 

	Expert dev => specify code well enough for a noob to understand => noob turns it into a prompt => gets the code 

	vs: Expert dev writes a prompt, gets the code
